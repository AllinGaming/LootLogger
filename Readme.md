# LootLogger (WoW 1.12 Addon)

LootLogger is a lightweight addon for World of Warcraft 1.12 (Vanilla) designed to track epic item looting and trading. It logs when a player receives a loot and if/when that item is later traded, showing the final owner of each item.

- Logs epic item loot messages and select rare container loots (e.g. Bag of Vast Horizons).

## ðŸ“¦ How It Works

- **LOOT Events**: Logged when an epic item is looted.
- **TRADE Events**: Logged when an item is traded to another player.
- The UI uses a two-pass system:
  1. Checks all `TRADED_TO` events and maps item â†’ latest recipient.
  2. Fills in missing owners with the original looter (`LOOT` event).
- Only the latest known owner is shown in the `/lootlog ui` window.
